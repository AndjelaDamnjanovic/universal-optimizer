- **Execution of the developed applications from provided source code**

    - Execute *stripped* illustrative example (executes VNS on Max-Ones problem with binary representation within `int`, uses classes only from`uo`) 

    .. code-block::
        :caption: Execute illustrative example

            > python example_vns_maxones_int_vns_exec

    - Execute *enhanced* illustrative example (executes VNS on Max-Ones problem with binary representation within `int`, uses classes from both `uo` and `app`) 

    .. code-block::
        :caption: Execute illustrative example

            > python example_vns_maxones_int_vns_exec_build


- **Execution of the developed applications from command line**
